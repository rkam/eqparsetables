- format output (vs. shell view via option) for boards

√ - split config into  members, apps, other
√   script to create the above
√   mod parser to read each one

- when processing files, using NOW, not date of file being processed
  (e.g. raid_by_groups_160508  when processing RaidRoster-20160503-192925.txt)

- when move data into db, accum unattached pets into pet_owner
  (saves having to re-export via GP)

√ - pet_owner.txt
    incorporate it (need SQL)
